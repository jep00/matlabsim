# Matlab Simulation and Algebra Coursework
This is a first year university coursework completed in 2018, uploaded after. It was my first major piece of coursework, and I received a grade of 90%. 
 
<em>In hindsight, amongst other changes, I should have saved the images into a seperate folder, but we live and we learn. I would change it, but I feel its more genuine not to: this is the level I was at when I did this piece of work.</em>

<b>The Task</b>

<em>Task One: Collision-less Brownian Motion</em>
- a. Plot 'walls' of a container and place up to 500 identical randomly distributed particles within the centre area (radius 100 units). Assign a random value of speed and direction to each particle individually (initial velocity) in a range, such as 10 to 50 units per time interval.
- b. Start your time 'ticking' in discreet intervals (dt) and calculate and plot the updated positions of particles every n time steps. Save every nth screenshot of the plot for your report.
- c. When a particle hits the 'walls'  it must be reflected to bounce back without any loss of energy; to demonstrate this, generate a few particles inside and plot the traces of their trajectories as thin solid lines behind. Stop the simulation after some collisions and save the resulting figure.
- d. The code should have the ability to switch on 'gravity': under the action of which, the particles must start to fall down (negative y-direction) and repeatedly bounce against the 'floor'. 
- e. Finally, incorporate a 'loss of energy' function (e.g. at each collision, the balls should lose x% of its speed).
- f. On a different plot, show how total energy stays the same in c) and decays in e). What about d)? Commend on your findings. 

<em>Task Two</em>
- For this task, you use your individual cubic function y(x), found by running the cubic.exe program on Moodle (unique for everyone using student I.D.):
- a. Find all stationary points of y(x); list their coordinates.
- b. Classify the points using the second derivative test.
- c. Plot y(x) and put small circular markets at the stationary points; put labels to indicate the classification.
- d. Find all the roots of y(x) = 0 and find the value of the integral of y(x) between the roots.

<em>Task Three</em>
- LaTeX report on Tasks 1 and 2.


<b>Learning Objectives</b>
- Use a variety of software, such as MATLAB and LaTeX;
- Develop a deeper understanding of mathematics and write mathematics effectively;
- Present work professionally in a variety of formats

<b>What I Learnt</b> / Prior to university, I had never really coded before: I'd never used MATLAB or LaTeX, so it was a new experience for me. I felt like I performed well given my inexperience: I didn't find MATLAB particularly easy and it took me a while to get to grips with it. Getting used to the style of university assignments was a challenge, too, rather than assessment being wholly exam-based.
